# Description
This is a react app that searches for books using the google books api. This app is currently only functioning as a react app that searches for the terms a user enters and then displays the results in cards, along with a thumbnail image and a button to link to the google books page for the item. As of yet I have been unable to connect a mongodb database to the react app, which would allow for the functionality of saving books to be viewed on the saved books page. This page would display books in the same way and with the same component as in the search results, but the props passed into this page would be coming from an api call that returns all books currently saved to the mongo database. These routes exist in this repository, however I have been unable to link the functionality of the react app together with the database. If you would like to run the react app, simply cd into the folder, books-search, and run npm start. This search functioanlity is complete.
